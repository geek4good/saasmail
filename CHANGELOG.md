## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Person-list search bar on iOS Safari: inputs with `font-size` below 16 px triggered automatic viewport zoom on focus. The search bar now uses 16 px text and a taller, more tappable input on mobile, reverting to the compact desktop size at the `sm` breakpoint.

### Dependencies

- Bumped the tiptap group (`@tiptap/extension-placeholder`, `@tiptap/pm`, `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`) from 3.22.4 to 3.22.5.
- Bumped `react` and `react-dom` from 18.3.1 to 19.2.5; bumped `@types/react` from 18.3.20 to 19.2.14.
- Bumped `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` from 3.11.0 to 4.3.0.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-30

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Full-text email search via FTS5: the search box now surfaces people whose emails match the query by subject or body text, not just by name or email address. An `emails_fts` FTS5 virtual table is created with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE triggers to keep the index in sync; existing emails are backfilled on migration. For members, FTS results are scoped to their permitted inboxes to prevent cross-inbox content leakage. The search box placeholder is updated to "Search…" and a clear (×) button appears when text is entered.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- Clicking a Web Push notification now deep-links directly to the person's conversation instead of landing on the generic inbox view. Two bugs were fixed: `InboxPage` now reads `personId` from URL params and falls back to `fetchPerson(id)` when the contact isn't already in the loaded list; the service worker now `postMessage`s the target URL to any open same-origin tab (falling back to `openWindow`), and `App.tsx` adds a `/inbox/:inbox/:personId` route with a `NotificationClickListener` that calls `navigate(url)` on receipt.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Web push notifications now successfully decrypt in Chrome and other browsers: `deriveAes128GcmKeys` was appending a redundant `0x01` counter byte to the HKDF info before calling `hkdfExpand`, but `hkdfExpand` (RFC 5869) already appends its own counter byte for the first output block. The double-`0x01` caused "AES-GCM decryption failed" in `chrome://gcm-internals` while FCM silently accepted the malformed ciphertext. A known-answer test against the RFC 8291 §5 vector has been added to catch future regressions.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `postcss` from 8.5.9 to 8.5.10 (dev dependency).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Browser push notifications: users can now receive push alerts for new emails without the tab being open, powered by the Web Push Protocol (VAPID).
- `push_subscriptions` table stores per-user browser subscriptions.
- `GET /api/notifications/config` returns the server's VAPID public key so the frontend can subscribe.
- `POST/DELETE /api/notifications/subscriptions` for managing push subscriptions.
- `/deliver` endpoint on `NotificationsHub` Durable Object fans out new-email events to active WebSocket connections and falls back to Web Push when no WebSocket is present.
- Service worker (`sw.js`) that handles incoming push events and displays system notifications.
- Push orchestration library in the frontend (`usePush`) that manages subscription lifecycle, permission requests, and server sync.
- Contextual opt-in banner shown in the inbox when push permission has not yet been granted.
- Notifications settings page where users can subscribe or unsubscribe from push alerts.
- "Settings" entry added to the user dropdown in the sidebar for quick access to the new page.
- `vapid:generate` script (`scripts/generate-vapid.ts`) to generate a VAPID keypair for new deployments.
- VAPID configuration step added to the onboarding and update skills.
- `VAPID_SUBJECT` added to `wrangler.jsonc.example` and regenerated `worker-configuration.d.ts`.
- E2E smoke test covering the notifications settings page.
- Admin delete-person action: admins can delete a person and all associated emails from the person list via a new kebab menu, with a confirmation dialog and `DELETE /api/people/:id` endpoint.

### Fixed

- Web push is now always attempted when a new email is delivered; the previous logic skipped push if any WebSocket was open, even for other users.
- Push subscription UI in settings now surfaces errors, shows a loading state, and prevents double-clicks while a request is in-flight.

### Changed

- `NotificationsHub` Durable Object now captures `env` in its constructor so the `/deliver` handler can access bindings without passing them per-call.
- `/deliver` path on `NotificationsHub` now logs missing VAPID config, empty subscription lists, non-2xx push responses, and thrown `sendPush` errors instead of silently swallowing them, and warns if `VAPID_SUBJECT` is not a valid `mailto:`/`https:` URL.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `actions/setup-node` from 4 to 6.
- Bumped `github/codeql-action` from 3 to 4.
- Bumped `actions/upload-artifact` from 4 to 7.
- Bumped `@codemirror/view` (codemirror group).
- Bumped the tiptap group (4 packages).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Real-time inbox updates via Durable Object WebSockets: the inbox, person list, and open conversation now refetch automatically when new mail arrives, without any manual refresh.
- `NotificationsHub` Durable Object maintains hibernatable, per-user WebSocket connections keyed by user ID so only the correct user's connections are notified.
- `/api/notifications/stream` WebSocket upgrade endpoint; session and inbox permissions are validated in the main worker before the connection is forwarded to the DO.
- `useRealtimeUpdates` React hook that opens a WebSocket, reconnects on close, and fires a callback on `email_received` events.
- `wrangler.jsonc.example` now documents the DO binding and the required v1 migration for fresh deployers.

### Changed

- Emails are now marked read only when the user explicitly clicks the mark-read control. Auto-marking on conversation open has been removed because it conflicted with the upstream `onEmailRead` callback contract and broke the unread-count-sync test.

### Security

- WebSocket upgrade endpoint validates the `Origin` header against `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to block Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Issue and pull-request templates, Code of Conduct, Dependabot config, CodeQL scanning, and `.editorconfig` for open-source community hygiene.
- Type-check step added to the CI test workflow.
- CI, license, and Cloudflare badges added to the README.

### Fixed

- Cloudflare Email Sending binding now works with custom headers (Message-ID, In-Reply-To): the sender rewrites outbound messages as raw MIME via `mimetext` instead of the object-form builder, which rejects non-whitelisted headers.
- Sidebar unread and total counts now update immediately when an email is read or deleted, instead of remaining stale until the next refetch.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Reply action is now available on sent messages, allowing you to continue outbound conversations from the person detail view.
- `/reply/{emailId}` endpoint accepts sent-email IDs in addition to received-email IDs.
- `message_id` column on `sent_emails` table; a standards-compliant Message-ID header is generated and persisted on every send, reply, and sequence delivery.
- `generateMessageId` helper in the worker for consistent Message-ID generation.
- Saasmail logo adopted as the default app branding; `APP_NAME` and `APP_LOGO_LETTER` environment variables removed.
- Email links inside message bodies open in a new tab.

### Changed

- Compose editor simplified to plain rich-text format with an enlarged modal.

### Fixed

- Reply endpoint now rejects sent-email IDs belonging to inboxes the caller does not own.
- Person detail header displays the contact's email address inline beside their name.
- Compose editor padding restored after accidental removal.
- Email attachments are now handled correctly end-to-end.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-18

- One unified timeline per customer, collapsing marketing, notifications, and support emails into a single per-person view.
